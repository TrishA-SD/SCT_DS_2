# Task 02 – Titanic Dataset: Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🛳️📊

## Objective

The goal of this task was to perform **data cleaning** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset to understand survival patterns and relationships between variables.

---

## Data Description

The dataset contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic:

* PassengerId
* Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
* Pclass (Ticket class: 1st, 2nd, 3rd)
* Name, Sex, Age
* SibSp (Siblings/Spouses aboard)
* Parch (Parents/Children aboard)
* Ticket, Fare, Cabin, Embarked

---

## Data Cleaning

* Removed rows with missing values (Age, Embarked, Fare).
* Dropped **Cabin** column due to too many missing values.
* Converted categorical values (e.g., Male/Female).

---

## Visualization Outputs

Created PivotTables and Charts in Excel to analyze:

1. **Overall Survival Count**

3. **Survival by Gender**

4. **Survival by Passenger Class**

5. **Survival by Age Groups** (grouped into bins)

## Repository Contents

Titanic\_EDA.xlsx → Excel file with cleaning + PivotTables
Screenshots/ → Folder containing chart screenshots
README.md → Documentation

---

## Conclusion

This task provided valuable hands-on experience in **Excel data cleaning, PivotTables, and visualization**. The Titanic dataset clearly shows how **gender, class, age, and wealth influenced survival rates**.

---

👉 Attach 2–3 screenshots in the README (just like Task 01) to make it visually appealing.
